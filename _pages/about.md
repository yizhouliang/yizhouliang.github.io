I'm a postdoc research associate at the [School of Mathematics](https://maths.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

I obtained my Ph.D. at the [Peking Unviersity](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2022. I worked as a Humboldt fellow at the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/) in 2022-2024.

My research focuses on the numerical analysis of partial differential equations. Particularly, most of my work is on the finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) with applications in magnetohydrodynamics and numerical relativity. I'm also interested of numerical analysis for eigenvalue problems, such as the Grossâ€“Pitaevskii eigenvalue problem and biharmonic eigenvalue problem.
