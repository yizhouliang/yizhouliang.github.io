I'm a postdoctoral research associate at the [School of Mathematics](https://maths.ed.ac.uk/), [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/).

I received my Ph.D. from [Peking University](https://english.pku.edu.cn/) in 2022. I worked as a Humboldt Fellow at the [University of Augsburg](https://www.uni-augsburg.de/en/) from 2022 to 2024.

My research focuses on the numerical analysis of partial differential equations. In particular, most of my work is on finite element exterior calculus (FEEC) with applications in numerical relativity. I'm also interested in numerical analysis of eigenvalue problems, such as the Grossâ€“Pitaevskii and biharmonic eigenvalue problems.

I moved to Oxford in September, 2025.
